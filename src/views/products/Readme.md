# Products Module

This folder contains all components, services, helpers, and utilities related to the **Products** feature in the application. The goal is to keep the feature modular, self-contained, and easy to maintain.

## 📌 Design Guidelines

- All services, helpers, and utilities **specific to the Products feature** should be placed **within this folder**, not in global/shared directories.
- If a function or service is **only used within a single feature (e.g., ProductForm)**, it should live in a **nested subfolder** under that specific component (e.g., `components/productForm`).
- This modular approach ensures that code is **organized by feature**, increasing reusability within the feature and keeping unrelated code separated.

---

## 🧠 Why This Structure?

- Product-specific logic is unlikely to be reused outside the products module.
- Keeping it scoped to the feature makes the code easier to manage and understand.
- Improves scalability by promoting **feature-based separation of concerns**.

## 🔧 Subfolder Details

### `components/productForm`

- Contains the reusable `ProductForm` component.
- Includes supporting service and utility files used only within the form.

### `helpers/`

- Contains helper functions used throughout different parts of the Products feature.

### `services/`

- Houses API/service-related logic used across the Products feature components.

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Do **not** move these utilities or services to a global/shared folder unless you are certain they are being reused across other modules.
- Maintain **single-responsibility** per file for better clarity and testability.
- Follow **consistent naming conventions** for easier traceability and understanding.
